# MERN-Exercise-Tracking-App
This web application project was completed as part of a web development course in my undergraduate CS degree. The app is a basic exercise tracker that gives the user the option to view a log of their tracked exercises, create a new exercise, edit an existing exercise, or delete an exercise from the log. The app was created using the MERN stack which incorporates MongoDB for storing the exercises in a database, Node.js and Express.js for the backend server, and React for the frontend user interface. The backend was developed using the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern and REST API.
